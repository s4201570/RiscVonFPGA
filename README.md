## Use of the InstantSOC Folder

Within the folder has the c++ files and the .HDL and .XDC files used for the final demo
you can use the c++ file to compile and build the VHDL files which uses the provided .xdc file.

With Vivado you can generate the bit stream.

** Note one file is a simulated file and should be treated only as one, its the 'example_TB' **
